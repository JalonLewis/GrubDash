Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment.
It allows developers to build server-side applications with minimal code and a simple and intuitive interface.

REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for building APIs that is based on HTTP methods and HTTP status codes.
It defines a set of constraints and best practices for creating APIs that are scalable, maintainable, and easy to use.

When building an API with Express.js, knowledge of RESTful principles is important for organizing and managing the data that the API will be handling.
This includes understanding how to define routes and URL patterns, as well as how to use middleware to add additional functionality to the API.

In this project, Express.js is used to build an API that follows RESTful principles.
The resulting API is able to handle requests to create, read, update, and delete data for multiple resources,
which allows developers to easily manage and manipulate data without needing to have in-depth knowledge of REST or state management.
