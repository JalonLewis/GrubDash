# GrubDash

This project utilizes Express.js to build an API following RESTful principals.

In order to store data for multiple resources with minimal code knowledge of REST and state management using Express was required.
Knoledge of the interworkings of routes, URL's, and middleware was required in order to define each element and implement the API.

The resulting API is able to handle requests to create, read, update, and delete data for multiple resources.
